\details{
Suppose that a bond \eqn{i} has a price \eqn{p_i} at time \eqn{t} with a
set of cash payments, say \eqn{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m} with a set of
corresponding discount values \eqn{d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_m}. In the bond
pricing literature, the market price of a bond should reflect the
discounted value of cash payments. Thus, we want to minimise
\deqn{(p_i-\sum^m_{j=1}c_j\times d_j)^2.} For the estimation of \eqn{d_k(k=1,
\ldots, m)}, solving the first order condition yields
\deqn{(p_i-\sum^m_{j=1}c_j \times d_j)c_k = 0, } and \deqn{\hat{d}_k =
\frac{p_i c_k}{c_k^2} - \frac{\sum^m_{j=1,k\neq k}c_k c_j d_j}{c_k^2}.}

There are challenges: \eqn{\hat{d}_k} depends on all the relevant discount
values for the cash payments of the bond. Our model contains random errors
and our interest lies in expected value of \eqn{d(.)} where the expected
value of errors is zero. \eqn{d(.)} is an infinite-dimensional function not
a discrete finite-dimensional vector. Generally, cash payments are made
biannually, not dense at all. Moreover, cash payment schedules vary over
different bonds.

Let \eqn{d(\tau, X_t)} be the discount function at given covariates
\eqn{X_t} (dates \code{x} and interest rates \code{rgrid}), and given
time-to-maturities \eqn{\tau} (\code{tau}). \eqn{y(\tau, X_t)} is the yield
curve at given covariates \eqn{X_t} (dates \code{x} and interest rates
\code{rgrid}), and given time-to-maturities \eqn{\tau} (\code{tau}).

We pursue the minimum of the following smoothed sample least squares
objective function for any smooth function \eqn{d(.)}: \deqn{Q(d) =
\sum^T_{t=1}\sum^n_{i=1}\int\{p_{it}-\sum^{m_{it}}_{j=1}c_{it}(\tau_{ij})d(s_{ij},
x)\}^2 \sum^{m_{it}}_{k=1}\{K_h(s_{ik}-\tau_{ik})ds_{ik}\}K_h(x-X_t)dx,}
where a bond \eqn{i} has a price \eqn{p_i} at time \eqn{t} with a set of cash
payments \eqn{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m} with a set of corresponding discount
values \eqn{d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_m}, \eqn{K_h(.) = K(./h)} is the kernel
function with a bandwidth parameter \eqn{h}, the first kernel function is
the kernel in space with bonds whose maturities \eqn{s_{ik}} are close to
the sequence \eqn{\tau_{ik}}, the second kernel function is the kernel in
time and in interest rates with \eqn{x}, which are close to the sequence
\eqn{X_t}. This means that bonds with similar cash flows, and traded in
contiguous days, where the short term interest rates in the market are
similar, are combined for the estimation of the discount function at a
point in space, in time, and in "interest rates".

The estimator for the discount function over time to maturity and time is
\deqn{\hat{d}=\arg\min_d Q(d).} This function provides a data frame of the
estimated yield and discount rate at each combination of the provided
grids. The estimated yield is transformed from the estimated discount rate.

An alternative specification of bandwidth \code{hx} is \code{span_x}, which provides
kernel coverage invariant to the length of \code{data}. \code{span_x} takes an
absolute measure of time depending on the unit of \code{x}. The default value is
60. If the data is daily on trading days, i.e., the interval between every
two consecutive \code{qdate} is one trading day, then the window of the kernel
function allows the estimation at each point \code{x} to contain information
from 60 trading days prior to and after the time point \code{x}.

\code{References}.
